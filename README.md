=> Overall Summary

This project, **FlavorForge – Internship Task 2**, demonstrates building a modern static website using **Nunjucks** as a templating engine and **Vite** as a bundler. The main objective was to recreate the previous Task 1 deliverables with a proper tech stack and workflow.

Key achievements include:

* **Templating with Nunjucks:** All pages (`index`, `about`, `contact`) were created using reusable templates for consistency and maintainability.
* **Bundling with Vite:** Automatic compilation and asset management ensures optimized and production-ready output.
* **Folder Structure & Deployment:**

  * `src/templates/` for templates
  * `src/assets/` for CSS and images
  * `dist/` for compiled HTML and assets, uploaded to **GitHub Pages**
* **Challenges Encountered:**

  * Broken image paths after building
  * Blank pages when navigating links
  * Explore Foods anchor link not scrolling
  * GitHub Pages deployment issues

All challenges were resolved by:

* Correcting image paths relative to the `dist` folder
* Ensuring anchor IDs matched navigation links
* Always building before uploading to GitHub Pages

Time Taken:10 hrs approx.

**Outcome:** A fully functional static website that mirrors Task 1, is responsive, visually consistent, and correctly deployed on GitHub Pages.
